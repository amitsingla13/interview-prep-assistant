        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: June 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using Interview Preparation Assistant ("the app"), you agree to be bound by these 
           Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the app.</p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>The app provides AI-powered practice tools including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>IT interview simulation with an AI interviewer</li>
            <li>Language speaking practice with AI conversation partners</li>
            <li>General-purpose AI chat assistant</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The service uses OpenAI's APIs to generate responses, transcribe speech, and produce audio output.</p>

        <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>When using the app, you agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not use the service for any illegal, harmful, or abusive purposes</li>
            <li>Not attempt to circumvent security measures, inject malicious prompts, or manipulate the AI</li>
            <li>Not upload harmful, offensive, or illegal content via voice or text</li>
            <li>Not attempt to reverse-engineer, scrape, or overload the service</li>
            <li>Use the service in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. AI-Generated Content Disclaimer</h2>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> All responses from the app are generated by artificial intelligence (OpenAI GPT). 
           The AI may produce inaccurate, incomplete, or biased information. Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interview responses and feedback are for <strong>practice purposes only</strong> and do not represent 
                actual hiring decisions or professional evaluations.</li>
            <li>Language corrections may not always be accurate. The app is a practice tool, not a certified language instructor.</li>
            <li>General chat responses should not be treated as professional advice (legal, medical, financial, etc.).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. No Guarantee of Results</h2>
        <p>Using this app does not guarantee success in actual interviews, language proficiency tests, or any other 
           real-world assessment. The app is a supplementary practice tool.</p>

        <h2>6. Content Moderation</h2>
        <p>We use automated content moderation to detect and filter harmful, abusive, or inappropriate content. 
           Users who repeatedly violate content policies may have their sessions terminated. 
           Rate limiting is enforced to ensure fair usage for all users.</p>

        <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The app's design, code, and system prompts are our intellectual property.</li>
            <li>AI-generated responses during your session are provided for your personal use.</li>
            <li>You retain rights to any original content you provide via voice or text input.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Service Availability</h2>
        <p>We strive to keep the app available but do not guarantee uninterrupted service. The app may be 
           temporarily unavailable due to maintenance, updates, or circumstances beyond our control. 
           We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the service at any time.</p>

        <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>The app is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
           we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages 
           arising from your use of the app.</p>

        <h2>10. Privacy</h2>
        <p>Your use of the app is also governed by our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, 
           which describes how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

        <h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes 
           constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
